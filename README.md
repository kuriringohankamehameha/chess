# chessengine
A Chess Engine to be implemented using Java

## TODO
* Smoothen movements of Pieces using the Squares class, if possible
* Add all Black King Checks
* Add CheckMate
* Add Castling
* Add EnPassant
* Add Multithreading Support
* Developing a Socket based Server for Multiplayer
* Construct an engine that uses Alpha-beta pruning to search moves via a moveset tree to trace out the best moves.
(Implementation could be done using a Patricia Trie for effective pruning)
* Develop a basic reinforcement learning AI using data from world championship Chess matches 
* Add Screenshots of the Java Application

## UPDATE

Discontinued as of now. Will resume when I have the time.

Need to add, optimize and refactor a lot of the code so as to suit OOP principles, but OOP isn't always the best way.
