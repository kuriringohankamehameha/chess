TODO:
1. Implement MouseListener for all Pieces such that they move only when they are clicked.
2. Make sure the repaint()/paintimmediately() method(s) don't crash the program. We must paint only if needed
3. Set COLORS for each of the pieces such that they're demarcated based on that
4. Move methods on each piece 
5. Deletepiece() 
6. Choices for Movement of pieces

UPDATE:
Add movement restricted to recentering around a square.
Movement should be confined only to squares
